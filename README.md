# TMA4195 - Synaptic Neurotransmission
Mathematical Modelling

We model the diffusion-reaction of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft between neurons in the brain.

## For grader
The implementation of 3D models is found in "3D Explicit Finite Differences.py"
The implementation of the geometrically reduced models using CN see
* synNeuroTrans.py: Plots-, figures- and resultsproducing code.
* numericalMethod.py: implementation of CN with both Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions used in synNeurTrans.py.
* plotFncs.py: misc plot functions used in synNeurTrans.py.
