# Synaptic Neurotransmission
Course: TMA4195 - Mathematical Modelling

Modelling of the diffusion-reaction of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft between neurons in the brain.

## For grader
The implementation of 3D models is found in "3D Explicit Finite Differences.py"  
The implementation of the geometrically reduced models using CN see
* synNeuroTrans.py: Plots-, figures- and resultsproducing code.
* numericalMethod.py:<br/>
implementation of CN with both Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions used in synNeurTrans.py.<br/>
* plotFncs.py: misc plot functions used in synNeurTrans.py.
